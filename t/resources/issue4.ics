DESCRIPTION:In this talk\, I will talk about why log files are horrible\, l
 ogging log lines\, and more structured performance metrics from large scal
 e production applications as well as building reliable\, scaleable and fle
 xible large scale software systems in multiple languages.\n\nWhy (almost) 
 all log formats are horrible will be explained\, and why JSON is a good so
 lution for logging will be discussed\, along with a number of message queu
 ing\, middleware and network transport technologies\, including STOMP\, AM
 QP and ZeroMQ.\n\nThe Message::Passing framework will be introduced\, alon
 g with the logstash.net project which the perl code is interoperable with.
  These are pluggable frameworks in ruby/java/jruby and perl with pre-writt
 en sets of inputs\, filters and outputs for many many different systems\, 
 message formats and transports.\n\nThey were initially designed to be aggr
 egators and filters of data for logging. However they are flexible enough 
 to be used as part of your messaging middleware\, or even as a replacement
  for centralised message queuing systems.\n\nYou can have your cake and ea
 t it too - an architecture which is flexible\, extensible\, scaleable and 
 distributed. Build discrete\, loosely coupled components which just pass m
 essages to each other easily.\n\nIntegrate and interoperate with your exis
 ting code and code bases easily\, consume from or publish to any existing 
 message queue\, logging or performance metrics system you have installed.\
 n\nSimple examples using common input and output classes will be demonstra
 ted using the framework\, as will easily adding your own custom filters. A
  number of common messaging middleware patterns will be shown to be trivia
 l to implement.\n\nSome higher level use-cases will also be explored\, dem
 onstrating log indexing in ElasticSearch and how to build a responsive pla
 tform API using webhooks.\n\nInteroperability is also an important goal fo
 r messaging middleware. The logstash.net project will be highlighted and w
 e'll discuss crossing the single language barrier\, allowing us to have fu
 ll integration between java\, ruby and perl components\, and to easily wri
 te bindings into libraries we want to reuse in any of those languages.

DESCRIPTION:Lots of perl people think that they're doing unit testing\, bec
 ause they test each module.  That is not unit testing.  Unit testing tests
  each indivisible unit of functionality *in isolation*\, testing not just 
 functions' return values for various arguments\, but also their interactio
 ns with other parts of your application by mocking those other parts.  Uni
 t testing makes tests far more useful as a debugging tool\, but also requi
 res changing how you think about writing code. In this talk I'll show how 
 you can make your code more debuggable with unit testing.

DESCRIPTION:The system environments which are running in the data centers t
 oday do have all different kinds of development servers\, staging servers\
 , production serers\, qa servers and probably servers for customer tests. 
 While the development guys are using continous integration build environme
 nts and unit tests to check if everything is working\, the operations depa
 rtments are often unable to deploy the software that has been successfully
  built. \n\nThe reasons may vary\, however\, some problems have to be deal
 t with all the time: automatic deployment and tracking dependencies. If yo
 u need to deploy Perl software across different environments\, you want to
  make sure that everything runs smoothly without interaction. The talks sh
 ows some strategies how to deal with those kind of problems. It will show 
 some development concepts which have been evolved in praxis. Setting up a 
 development toolchain based on puppet/rpm can be one solution for dependen
 y problems.  For those who are in the BSD worlds\, the talk will explain h
 ow to use the NetBSD pkgsrc tree for software deployment.

DESCRIPTION:Multi-paradigm languages like Perl can absorb programming pract
 ices from all over the programming map and the more languages you have at 
 least a nodding acquaintance with\, the more ways you have to crack your p
 articular nut\, skin your particular cat\, or carve up the turkey of a pro
 blem you’ve been presented.\n\nI’ll discuss some techniques and ideas I’ve
  stolen from my messing about with other languages\, and show you how to c
 ultivate your own plundering habits.\n\nThis talk will not be delivered wh
 ile talking like a pirate for forty minutes. It will\, however\, be delive
 red while bearded.
